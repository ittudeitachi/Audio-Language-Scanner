**Audio Language Scanner** is a Python tool that extracts a segment of audio from video files and uses [AccentGenerator](https://accentgenerator.com/) to detect the spoken language and provide a transcript.

---

## 🛠 Features

- Extracts audio from video formats: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`
- Converts selected time segment to `.mp3` using FFmpeg
- Sends audio to AccentGenerator API
- Detects spoken language
- Returns translated transcript

---

## 📁 How It Works

- The script **recursively scans all subfolders** inside your specified root directory.
- It **only processes the first valid video file** found in each folder.
- The audio segment (e.g. minute 25–35) is extracted using `ffmpeg`.
- The output `.mp3` file is sent to AccentGenerator.com for detection and translation.

## 📂 Folder Structure Example

```
ROOT_DIR/
├── Movie1/
│   └── SomeFile.mkv     ← ✅ This file will be processed
├── Movie2/
│   ├── Cover.jpg         ← ❌ Ignored
│   └── Film.mp4          ← ✅ First valid video gets processed
```

> ⚠️ Only one video per folder is scanned — make sure each movie folder contains **one target video** as the first detectable file.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Open `main.py` and edit the following lines:

```python
# 👇 Path to your video collection
ROOT_DIR = r"F:\Path\To\Your\Video\Folders"

# ⏱️ Audio time range (HH:MM:SS)
START_TIME = "00:25:00"
END_TIME = "00:35:00"

# 🔐 CSRF Token from AccentGenerator.com
CSRF_TOKEN = 'your-own-token-here'
```

## 🔐 How to Get CSRF Token

1. Visit: [https://accentgenerator.com/ai-detect-language/](https://accentgenerator.com/ai-detect-language/)
2. Upload a small `.mp3` file
3. Open Developer Tools > Network tab
4. Find the request to `/detectLanguageTranslate/`
5. Copy the `csrftoken` from the **Headers** or **Cookies**
